                            <p class="lead">There are two updates concerning the counter: First the whole project is available on <a href="https://github.com/felix185/dart-counter">GitHub</a>. It's a public project - feel free to fork it but changes can only be made by collaborators.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Furthermore I've implemented an "Undo" button. By pressing the "Undo" button (next to the "Next" button) the last action is reversed. At the moment it's only allowed to undo one action - in further development there will be the possibility to reset more actions.</p>
                            <p class="lead">My next steps in development can be found as an issue in the GitHub Repository. If anybody finds a bug, feel free to open a new issue with a description of the bug.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Also the updates of the counter will take longer the next few months since I have many projects to do for university and I'm going to write the paper for my bachelor's degree, too.</p>

                            <p class="lead">You don't have to enter all names now - you can start the game and the placeholder will be set as name for empty input fields. I've also fixed the bug which you might came across by trying to restart the same game.

                            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Good evening guys! Here is the new version of my <a href="counterSettings.html">Dart Counter</a>!</h2>
                            <p class="lead">There are some <b>new features</b> coming with the new counter: First it's now possible to play alone or to play with more than two players.
                              Furthermore you can decide whether you want to play until all players have finished or restart the game.
                              That's the next feature: You could restart the game with the same settings or you can change your settings.
                              The last feature is a table which shows the results of the current game.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">You have to enter <b>all</b> names of the players in the settings and you can choose whether you want to play 501 (default) or 301.
                              It's possible to play with Double-Out (default) and Single-Out - feel free to click the buttons for each setting.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">As introduced in the last version there are buttons with numbers for touch-devices like tablets or smartphones - the design is responsive which makes the counter looking good on mobile devices, too.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">I'm thinking of introducing more statistics and tips for the players what they have to score to finish the game in the next version which I will probably publish next year.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Now you're ready for playing darts! Game on!</p>
                            <p class="lead">P.S.: I know that I've promised also a new design of this website - but I don't have much time at the moment so you have to wait a bit longer for that! Sorry!</p>

                            <p class="lead">To make the counter more useful even for smartphones and tablets I decided to introduce clickable numbers.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Now you can decide whether you want to enter your score via the keypad or by clicking the buttons. To remove the last number you have to press the button with the left arrow.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Hopefully there will be another release in the next few weeks. I want to implement a better player handling. It should be possible to play alone or with more than one other player, too.</p>
                            <p class="lead">With the next release the design of this webpage will also be changed.</p>

                            <p class="lead">It's a counter for two players. You can decide whether you want to play with single or double out. It's also possible to choose between playing 301 or 501. I will improve it at some point in the future, e.g. to play with more players but I have no time for more development at the moment.</p>
                            <p class="lead">To choose your settings you just have to click the buttons. In the line above the players you can see the current settings. Default settings are 501 with double out. If you finished a game you can start a new one by clicking any button. Also you could enter your names if you want. The results of your previous throws can be seen under your current score.</p>
                            <p class="lead">You can enter any score from 0 to 180. If you have no score just click the button "Next Player!" or press your return key on the keyboard.</p>

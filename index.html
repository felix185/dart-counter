                            <p class="lead">I will not go on with the development of the counter on this website. I want to develop a complete new counter instead and the work has already begon.</p>
                            <p class="lead">I want to develop a counter with a Backend instead of using only client-side technologies.</p>
                            <p class="lead">There is already a <a href="https://github.com/felix185/countDarto" target="_blank">Github Repository</a> for the new counter.</p>
                            <p class="lead">I can't tell you when I will release the first version of the counter as I have so many ideas for it. Also I have a new job as Software Engineer and I can't estimate how much time I can invest in the development of the new counter.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Nevertheless, I will not delete the counter from this website.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Happy coding to everybody and Game on!</p>

                            <p class="lead">As I'm currently preparing for a tournament which takes place in 2 weeks, I introduced a new game for a better training: the 170 Game. The goal of this game is to check 170 (which is the highest number to check with 3 darts - at least if you play Double Out) with as few darts as possible.</p>
                            <p class="lead">So this game is very good to train your checkouts.</p>
                            <p class="lead">I made also some small changes in design - but nothing spectacular.</p>
                            <p class="lead">I'm looking forward to the tournament in two weeks and I hope I can defend my title as "Campo Los Teuros Darts Champion" but it will get very hard I think.</p>
                            <p class="lead">The plans for a complete new Dart Counter have also begon - it will be much work to do and many lines of code but it will be fantastic! I can't tell you when I will have finished it but I think it won't be finished in this year since I have many other things to do at the moment.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Game on!</p>

                            <p class="lead">There are two updates concerning the counter: First the whole project is available on <a href="https://github.com/felix185/dart-counter" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. It's a public project - feel free to fork it but changes can only be made by collaborators.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Furthermore I've implemented an "Undo" button. By pressing the "Undo" button (next to the "Next" button) the last action is reversed. At the moment it's only allowed to undo one action - in further development there will be the possibility to reset more actions.</p>
                            <p class="lead">My next steps in development can be found as an issue in the GitHub Repository. If anybody finds a bug, feel free to open a new issue with a description of the bug.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Also the updates of the counter will take longer the next few months since I have many projects to do for university and I'm going to write the paper for my bachelor's degree, too.</p>

                            <p class="lead">There are some <b>new features</b> coming with the new counter: First it's now possible to play alone or to play with more than two players.
                              Furthermore you can decide whether you want to play until all players have finished or restart the game.
                              That's the next feature: You could restart the game with the same settings or you can change your settings.
                              The last feature is a table which shows the results of the current game.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">You have to enter <b>all</b> names of the players in the settings and you can choose whether you want to play 501 (default) or 301.
                              It's possible to play with Double-Out (default) and Single-Out - feel free to click the buttons for each setting.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">As introduced in the last version there are buttons with numbers for touch-devices like tablets or smartphones - the design is responsive which makes the counter looking good on mobile devices, too.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead">I'm thinking of introducing more statistics and tips for the players what they have to score to finish the game in the next version which I will probably publish next year.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Now you're ready for playing darts! Game on!</p>
                            <p class="lead">P.S.: I know that I've promised also a new design of this website - but I don't have much time at the moment so you have to wait a bit longer for that! Sorry!</p>

                            <p class="lead">To make the counter more useful even for smartphones and tablets I decided to introduce clickable numbers.</p>
                            <p class="lead">Now you can decide whether you want to enter your score via the keypad or by clicking the buttons. To remove the last number you have to press the button with the left arrow.</p>

                            <p class="lead">It's a counter for two players. You can decide whether you want to play with single or double out. It's also possible to choose between playing 301 or 501. I will improve it at some point in the future, e.g. to play with more players but I have no time for further development at the moment.</p>
                            <p class="lead">To choose your settings you just have to click the buttons. In the line above the players you can see the current settings. Default settings are 501 with double out. If you finished a game you can start a new one by clicking any button. Also you could enter your names if you want. The results of your previous throws can be seen under your current score.</p>
                            <p class="lead">You can enter any score from 0 to 180. If you have no score just click the button "Next Player!" or press your return key on the keyboard.</p>

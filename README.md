# dart-counter

Repository for my personal [website](http://felix-riess.de/)

This page includes a simple dart counter which is realized via JavaScript.
I'm using Bootstrap and JQuery.
At the moment there is no backend.

## Tools
- JQuery
- Bootstrap 

## How to run the project 
That's easy: just clone/download this repository and open the file "index.html". Have fun!
